## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for Indiana state prisons from public records requests to the Indiana Department of Corrections.

Example files included in corresponding documents folder. 

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of corresponding variables and linking data to UCLA datasets. 

```{r}
# Load IN decedent data
in.deaths <- read_CMP_deaths(agencies = 'IN')

# Show variables present in IN decedent data
colnames(in.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is present - join UCLA facility data
in.deaths %>%
    pull_CMP_fac_data()

# Compare CMP data with BJS data
compare_CMP_bjs(source = 'MCI') %>%
    subset(State == 'Indiana') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot IN decedent data 
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = in.deaths %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()),aes(x = Year, y = Total.Deaths))

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA currently does not have demographic data processed for Indiana state prisons. Please wait for the next update to this data.
