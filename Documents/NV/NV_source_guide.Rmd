## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for Nevada state prisons from public records requests to the Nevada Department of Corrections.

Example files included in corresponding documents folder.

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of corresponding variables and linking data 
to UCLA datasets. 

```{r}
# Load NV decedent data
nv.deaths <- harmonize_ucla_deaths(agencies = 'NV')

# Show variables present in NV decedent data
colnames(nv.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is present - join UCLA facility data
nv.deaths %>%
    pull_ucla_fac_data()

# Compare UCLA data with BJS data
compare_ucla_bjs() %>%
    subset(State == 'Nevada') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot NV decedent data (wrangled to monthly numbers)
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = nv.deaths %>% group_by(Year, Month) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()) %>% 
                  mutate(Date = as.Date(str_c(Year,Month,'01'), format = '%Y%B%d')),
              aes(x = Date, y = Total.Deaths)
              )

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA obtains custodial demographic data for Nevada state prisons from annual population reports from the Nevada Department of Corrections.

Example files in corresponding folder and links to reports in raw data file.

Some processing of the files takes place. 

```{r}
# Load NV demographic data
nv.demographics <- harmonize_ucla_dem(agencies = 'NV')

# Show NV demographic data to assess origin type
head(nv.demographics)

# The origin type is combined. This means that age and sex groups were aggregated and reported together.  

# Plot NV demographic data 
ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = nv.demographics %>% group_by(Date, Age) %>% summarise(Number = sum(Number, na.rm = TRUE)),
             aes(x = Date, y = Number, fill = Age), stat = 'identity') +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) # To see dates on x axis
