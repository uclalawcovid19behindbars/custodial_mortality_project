## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for Nebraska state prisons from public records requests to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services.

Example files included in corresponding documents folder. 

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of corresponding variables and linking data to UCLA datasets. 

```{r}
# Load NE decedent data
ne.deaths <- read_ucla_deaths(agencies = 'NE')

# Show variables present in NE decedent data
colnames(ne.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is not present - please wait for data update to join UCLA facility data

# Compare UCLA data with BJS data
compare_ucla_bjs(source = 'MCI') %>%
    subset(State == 'Nebraska') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot NE decedent data 
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = ne.deaths %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()),aes(x = Year, y = Total.Deaths))

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA currently does not have demographic data processed for Nebraska state prisons. Please wait for the next update to this data.
