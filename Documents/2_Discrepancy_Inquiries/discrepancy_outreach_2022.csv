Louisiana (LA),18 fewer deaths in project records compared with BJS MCI reports (2015).,NA,"The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections is responsible for reporting to DOJ deaths in prisons and also deaths of people convicted but serving their state sentence in locally or privately operated jails.  BJS MCI reports for LDPSC therefore may contain information on deaths-in-custody that occur outside of prisons. 

When records on deaths-in-custody from IT for prisons alone are aggregated annually, there are fewer deaths per year than reported for LA in BJS MCI reports. When records on deaths-in-custody from IT for all convicted individuals in LA carceral facilities (excluding juvenile facilities) are aggregated annually, there are more deaths per year than contained in BJS MCI reports, but the total counts are closer. The project believes IT records reliably capture deaths in LA prisons and only observations for deaths in LA prison facilities are reproduced in this repository and used to produce summary files."
