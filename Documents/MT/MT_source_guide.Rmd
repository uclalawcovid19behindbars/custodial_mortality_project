## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for Montana state prisons from public records requests to the Montana Department of Corrections.

Example files included in corresponding documents folder.

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of corresponding variables and linking data to UCLA datasets. 

```{r}
# Load MT decedent data
mt.deaths <- harmonize_ucla_deaths(agencies = 'MT')

# Show variables present in MT decedent data
colnames(mt.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is present - join UCLA facility data
mt.facility <- mt.deaths %>%
                pull_ucla_fac_data()
head(mt.facility)

# Compare UCLA data with BJS data
compare_ucla_bjs() %>%
    subset(State == 'Montana') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot MT decedent data (wrangled to monthly numbers)
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = mt.deaths %>% group_by(Year, Month) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()) %>% 
                  mutate(Date = as.Date(str_c(Year,Month,'01'), format = '%Y%B%d')),
              aes(x = Date, y = Total.Deaths)
              )

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA obtains custodial demographic data for Montana state prisons from annual population reports from the Montana Department of Corrections.

Example files in corresponding folder and links to reports in raw data file.

Some processing of the files takes place. 

```{r}
# Load MT demographic data
mt.demographics <- harmonize_ucla_dem(agencies = 'MT')

# Show MT demographic data to assess origin type
head(mt.demographics)

# The origin type is distinct. This means that age groups were reported seperately from sex groups for demographic data. In order to construct age and sex groups for a date from this distinct data, we applied reported sex ratios to each age group. This assumption is likely incorrect.   

# Plot MT demographic data 
ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = mt.demographics %>% group_by(Date, Age) %>% summarise(Number = sum(Number, na.rm = TRUE)),
             aes(x = Date, y = Number, fill = Age), stat = 'identity') +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) # To see dates on x axis



```
