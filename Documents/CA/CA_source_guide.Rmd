## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for California state prisons from the California Department of Justice OpenJustice Data Portal.

Link to data portal: https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/data

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of CDCR observations and corresponding variables and linking data to UCLA datasets. Data was last pulled from CA DOJ in July 2022 and data files we clipped to only contain deaths for full years (i.e. up to 2020).

```{r}
# Load CA decedent data
ca.deaths <- read_CMP_deaths(agencies = 'CA')

# Show variables present in CA decedent data
colnames(ca.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is present - join UCLA facility data
ca.deaths %>%
    pull_CMP_fac_data()

# Compare CMP data with BJS data
compare_CMP_bjs(source = 'MCI') %>%
    subset(State == 'California') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot CA decedent data 
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = ca.deaths %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()),aes(x = Year, y = Total.Deaths))

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA obtains custodial demographic data for California state prisons from bi-annual population reports from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).

Link to report page: https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/offender-outcomes-characteristics/offender-data-points/

Some processing of the files takes place. Example files included in corresponding documents folder. 

```{r}
# Load CA demographic data
ca.demographics <- harmonize_CMP_dem(agencies = 'CA')

# Show CA demographic data to assess origin type
head(ca.demographics)

# The origin type is distinct. This means that age groups were reported separately from sex groups for demographic data. In order to construct age and sex groups for a date from this distinct data, we applied reported sex ratios to each age group. This assumption is likely incorrect.

# Plot CA demographic data 
ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = ca.demographics %>% group_by(Date, Age) %>% summarise(Number = sum(Number, na.rm = TRUE)),
             aes(x = Date, y = Number, fill = Age), stat = 'identity')+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) # To see dates on x axis
