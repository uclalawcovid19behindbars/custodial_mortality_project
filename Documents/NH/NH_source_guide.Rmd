## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for New Hampshire state prisons from public records requests to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections.

Example files included in corresponding documents folder. 

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of corresponding variables and linking data to UCLA datasets. 

```{r}
# Load NH decedent data
nh.deaths <- read_ucla_deaths(agencies = 'NH')

# Show variables present in NH decedent data
colnames(nh.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is not present - please wait for data update to join UCLA facility data

# Compare UCLA data with BJS data
compare_ucla_bjs(source = 'MCI') %>%
    subset(State == 'New Hampshire') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot NH decedent data 
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = nh.deaths %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()),aes(x = Year, y = Total.Deaths))

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA currently does not have demographic data processed for New Hampshire state prisons. Please wait for the next update to this data.
