## Decedent Data

UCLA obtains custodial decedent data for Oregon state prisons from public records requests to the Oregon Department of Corrections.

Example files included in corresponding documents folder.

Some processing of the files takes place, including the selection of corresponding variables and linking data 
to UCLA datasets. 

```{r}
# Load OR decedent data
or.deaths <- harmonize_ucla_deaths(agencies = 'OR')

# Show variables present in OR decedent data
colnames(or.deaths)

# UCLA.ID is present - join UCLA facility data
or.facility <- or.deaths %>%
                pull_ucla_fac_data()
head(or.facility)

# Compare UCLA data with BJS data
compare_ucla_bjs() %>%
    subset(State == 'Oregon') %>%
    arrange(desc(Year))

# Plot OR decedent data (wrangled to monthly numbers)
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = or.deaths %>% group_by(Year, Month) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()) %>% 
                  mutate(Date = as.Date(str_c(Year,Month,'01'), format = '%Y%B%d')),
              aes(x = Date, y = Total.Deaths)
              ) +
    geom_smooth(data = or.deaths %>% group_by(Year, Month) %>% summarise(Total.Deaths = n()) %>% 
                  mutate(Date = as.Date(str_c(Year,Month,'01'), format = '%Y%B%d')),
              aes(x = Date, y = Total.Deaths)
              )

```


## Demographic Data

UCLA obtains custodial demographic data for Oregon state prisons from public records requests to the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC). 

Some processing of the files takes place. 

```{r}
# Load OR demographic data
or.demographics <- harmonize_ucla_dem(agencies = 'OR')

# Show OR demographic data to assess origin type
head(or.demographics)

# The origin type is distinct. This means that age groups were reported seperately from sex groups for demographic data. In order to construct age and sex groups for a date from this distinct data, we applied reported sex ratios to each age group. This assumption is likely incorrect.   

# Plot OR demographic data 
ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = or.demographics %>% group_by(Date, Age) %>% summarise(Number = sum(Number, na.rm = TRUE)),
             aes(x = Date, y = Number, fill = Age), stat = 'identity') +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) # To see dates on x axis
